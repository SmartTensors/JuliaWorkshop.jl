# Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Support Vector Regression (SVR) analysis utilizing the [libSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) library.

SVR is a module of [MADS](http://madsjulia.github.io/Mads.jl) (Model Analysis & Decision Support).

SVR is one of the most powerfull and easy to use machine-learning methods.



## Example #1: Predict vector `y` based on vector `x`



Below, `SVR` results using diferent kernels are demonsrated.

Predict `y` based on `x` using `RBF` (radial basis function); the solutions almost perfectly overlap:

Predict `y` based on `x` using `LINEAR`:

Predict `y` based on `x` using `POLY`:

## Example: Predicting a simple function

`SVR` is trainied to predict 3 paramter function: `a * sqrt(t) + b * t + c`, where `a`, `b` and `c` are the rows of a random matrix `y`:

The training set `x` looks like this:

We train `SVR` to predict `x` given `y`

After that we want to predict `x` for a given values of `a`, `b` and `c`

The obtained result looks like this:
